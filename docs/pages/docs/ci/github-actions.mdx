# Using Titanrepo with GitHub Actions

The following example shows how to use Titanrepo with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

For a given root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-titanrepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "titan run build",
    "test": "titan run test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "titan": "1.2.5"
  }
}
```

And a `titan.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://titan.khulnasoft.com/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": []
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": []
    },
  }
}
```

Create file called `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">

## Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching with GitHub Actions, add the following environment variables to your GitHub Actions workflow
to make them available to your `titan` commands.

- `TITAN_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TITAN_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Khulnasoft Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Khulnasoft Dashboard](https://khulnasoft.com/account/tokens)

![Khulnasoft Access Tokens](/images/docs/khulnasoft-tokens.png)
![Khulnasoft Access Tokens](/images/docs/khulnasoft-create-token.png)

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your GitHub repository settings and click on the **Secrets** and then **Actions** tab. Create a new secret called `TITAN_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

![GitHub Secrets Create](/images/docs/github-actions-create-secret.png)

3. Make a second secret called `TITAN_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Khulnasoft URL _without_ the `khulnasoft.com/`. Your Team URL can be found inside your team's general project settings from the dashboard.

   If you're using a Hobby Plan, you can use your username. Your username can be found in your [Khulnasoft Personal Account Settings](https://khulnasoft.com/account)

4. At the top of your GitHub Actions workflow, provide the following environment variables to jobs that use `titan`:

```yaml highlight="6-8"
# ...

jobs:
  build:
      name: Build and Test
      timeout-minutes: 15
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      # To use Titanrepo Remote Caching, set the following environment variables for the job.
      env:
        TITAN_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TITAN_TOKEN }}
        TITAN_TEAM: ${{ secrets.TITAN_TEAM }}

      steps:
        - name: Check out code
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
          with:
            fetch-depth: 2
      # ...
```
