# Titanrepo Quickstart

Titanrepo is an intelligent **build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases**.

Your codebase's tasks - like `lint`, `build` and `test` - **don't run as fast as they could**. Titanrepo uses [caching](/docs/core-concepts/caching) to titancharge your local setup and speed up your CI.

Titanrepo is designed to be **incrementally adopted**, so you can add it to most codebases in a few minutes.

## Features

Titanrepo leverages advanced build system techniques to speed up development, **both on your local machine and your CI/CD**.

## Monorepos

Titanrepo works out-of-the-box with monorepo tools like `npm`, `pnpm` and `yarn`. If you've ever felt that your monorepo slowed you down, it might be time for Titanrepo.

## Examples

You can also clone a Titanrepo starter repository to get a head start on your monorepo. For even more examples and starters, see the [Titanrepo examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/khulnasoft/titanrepo/tree/main/examples).
